#Makefile - Handy tools for compilation

In the previous section, you have learnt a lot about the using `gcc` to compile source codes. It will be more difficult when the scale of the project is getting larger. 

To manage compilation more easier, we can make use of `Makefile`.

By using the previous example, we have 

- Header file
    - `int_header.h`
- C implementation files
    - `add_int.c`
    - `multi_int.c`
    - `main.c`
